# OpenClaw Tools

A public, shareable repository of OpenClaw skills, scripts, benchmarks, and utilities that any AI agent workspace can adopt.

## What This Is

- **Skills**: Sanitized, reusable OpenClaw skills (SKILL.md + scripts)
- **Scripts**: Generic shell/Python scripts for AI agent workspaces
- **Tests**: Benchmarks and test harnesses for OpenClaw capabilities
- **Docs**: Documentation on how to use, contribute, and extend

## What This Is NOT

- NOT a personal workspace (that's your private workspace)
- NOT a place for secrets, API keys, or personal configuration
- NOT a project-specific repo (physics, etc. stay elsewhere)

## Contributing

1. Sanitize: No personal references, no specific paths, no secrets
2. Document: Every skill/script has a README or SKILL.md
3. Test: Scripts work out of the box (with sensible defaults)
4. Version: Skills have versions, changelogs
