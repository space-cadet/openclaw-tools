## T5: Token Usage Tracking System ✅ COMPLETE (2026-07-15) — Phase 5: parse.py Enhancement (2026-07-16) — v2.1.0 Rolling Windows (2026-07-21) — v2.2.0 Multi-Source Pricing (2026-07-23)
- [x] **Phase 1: SQLite Database + Incremental Ingestion**
- [x] **Phase 2: Cron Jobs**
- [x] **Phase 3: Rotation & Retention**
- [x] **Phase 4: Dashboard/Reporting**
- [x] **Phase 5: Direct Parser Enhancement**

  - [x] Update `SKILL.md` — document both direct parser (recommended) and SQLite (optional) approaches
  - [x] Update `skill-card.md` — v1.2.0 with new commands and examples
  - [x] Switch workspace cron jobs to use `parse.py` (accurate, no DB overhead)
  - [x] Keep SQLite tools available for advanced use cases (SQL queries, long-term retention)
- [x] **v2.1.0: Rolling Time Windows & Performance**

  - [x] Fix `parse.py` None cache pricing bug (TypeError)
  - [x] Integrate pricing refresh into weekly cron
  - [x] Update version to 2.2.0 in `skills-registry.json`, `SKILL.md`, `skill-card.md`
  - [x] **ClawHub publish**: v2.2.4 live (latest tag, 307 downloads)
  - [x] Commit: `37f65af`

### Design Decisions (Updated 2026-07-23)
- **Direct parser is primary for cron jobs**: `parse.py` reads session JSONL directly, produces accurate numbers without SQLite overhead
- **SQLite remains available**: For advanced querying, dashboards, and long-term retention beyond session files
- **Cost accuracy**: parse.py produces consistent cost estimates ($1.61 vs SQLite's $6.20 for same day — the SQLite approach had classification/aggregation issues)
- **Multi-source pricing**: Moonshot direct rates take priority for Kimi models (most accurate), OpenRouter as fallback + comparison
- **No breaking changes**: Existing `ingest.py`/`report.py` users unaffected

### Files Created/Modified
- `skills/token-usage/scripts/parse.py` — Added `--yesterday` flag (+5 lines)
- `skills/token-usage/SKILL.md` — Rewrote to document both approaches
- `skills/token-usage/skill-card.md` — Updated to v1.2.0

### Cron Jobs (Workspace — Updated 2026-07-16)
| Job | Schedule | Tool | Purpose |
|-----|----------|------|---------|
| Token Usage — Daily Report | 04:00 IST daily | `parse.py --yesterday --costs` | Yesterday's usage by model |
| Token Usage — Weekly Report | Monday 09:00 IST | `parse.py --week --costs` | 7-day trend + cost summary |

(Previous SQLite-based cron jobs disabled — see T5 Phase 2 history)

## T6: Documentation & Polish ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Each skill: SKILL.md with usage
- [x] Each skill: skill-card.md (quick reference)
- [x] Each script: header comment with purpose, usage, dependencies
- [x] Top-level README: index of all skills/scripts
- [x] skills-registry.json: machine-readable skill index
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI (optional, for tests)

## T7: K3 Benchmark (2026-07-17) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Run LISP interpreter test — 14/14 (100%), perfect score
- [x] Run subagent stress tests — 4/5 PASS, 1 PARTIAL (nested subagents blocked by design)
- [x] Compare with K2.6 (8/11) and K2.7 Code (10/11) results
- [x] Save interpreter.py and results.md to tests/kimi-benchmarks/k3/
- [x] Push to repo

### Results
| Test | K2.6 | K2.7 Code | K3 |
|------|------|-----------|-----|
| LISP Interpreter | 8/11 (72.7%) | 10/11 (90.9%) | **14/14 (100%)** |
| Basic Spawn | — | — | ✅ PASS |
| Tool Access | — | — | ✅ PASS |
| Model Override | — | — | ⚠️ PARTIAL (nested blocked) |
| Parallel Spawn | — | — | ✅ PASS |
| Timeout Stress | — | — | ✅ PASS |

### Key Finding
K3 is a significantly better coder than K2.7 and K2.6. Subagent spawning works reliably at depth 1. Nested subagents (depth > 1) are blocked by the runtime as a safety guardrail.

## T8: Cron Management Skill (2026-07-20) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `cron-management` skill with SKILL.md, _meta.json, skill-card.md
- [x] Create `scripts/cronctl.sh` — CLI for listing, pausing, resuming, maintenance mode
- [x] Test all commands: list, status, pause, resume, pause-all, resume-all, maintenance, health
- [x] Update skills-registry.json
- [x] Update memory-bank (activeContext, progress, tasks)
- [x] Push to repo

### Features
- `cronctl list` — show all jobs with ✅/❌ status
- `cronctl pause <name>` / `cronctl resume <name>` — single job toggle
- `cronctl pause-all` / `cronctl resume-all` — bulk operations
- `cronctl maintenance on|off` — emergency stop via `/tmp/cron-paused` flag
- `cronctl status` — health dashboard with failing/disabled/overdue counts
- `cronctl health <name>` — detailed run history and diagnostics

### Integration Guide Added
- Shell scripts, Python, Node.js examples for maintenance mode checks
- Rollout strategy for existing jobs
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/cron-management.md` with full architecture

### Why This Exists
OpenClaw has no built-in `enable`/`disable` command for cron jobs. The user had to manually disable 12+ jobs during a billing issue. This skill provides:
1. **Structured CLI** — no more raw JSON patches
2. **Bulk operations** — pause/resume all at once
3. **Maintenance mode** — works even if OpenClaw is down
4. **Health visibility** — see failures without digging through individual job states

### T8 maintenance update (2026-08-16)
- [x] Updated single-job and bulk pause/resume operations for the current OpenClaw CLI (`cron disable` / `cron enable`).
- [x] Included disabled jobs in lookup so paused jobs can be resumed.
- [x] Documented the compatibility fix in the cron-management implementation notes.


## T9: Import mem-* Skills from .agents (2026-07-28) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Copy `mem-update`, `mem-scan`, `mem-format`, `mem-load` from `~/.agents/skills/`
- [x] Adapt `mem-update` with project-repo awareness (Step 0)
  - [x] Scan `code/*/memory-bank/` before workspace memory-bank
  - [x] Prevent duplicate tasks across workspace and project repos
- [x] Sanitize paths: remove `/Users/deepak/`, `/Users/sage/`, replace with `~/` and `${MB_CORE_PATH}`
- [x] Update `skills-registry.json` (25 skills total)
- [x] Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
- [x] Create edit record
- [x] Commit and push

### Why This Matters
The `mb-text-workflow` skill had a critical flaw: it defaulted to workspace memory-bank without checking if the task belonged to a project repo. This caused T35c (timesarrow task) to be created in workspace memory-bank instead of timesarrow's memory-bank. The new `mem-update` skill fixes this by scanning ALL repos before creating tasks.

### Files Added
- `skills/mem-update/SKILL.md` — Enhanced v6.12 compliance with project-repo awareness
- `skills/mem-scan/SKILL.md` — Multi-repo deep scan
- `skills/mem-format/SKILL.md` — Template compliance validation
- `skills/mem-load/SKILL.md` — Context loading utility

## T12: Kimi Retry Storm Monitor ✅ COMPLETE (2026-08-17)
- [x] Create `scripts/kimi-retry-monitor.sh` — gateway log tail approach
- [x] Create `launchd/ai.openclaw.kimi-retry-monitor.plist` — macOS auto-start
- [x] Implement burst detection (3 in-flight, 4 in 10s)
- [x] Implement 429/rate-limit detection
- [x] Implement `check [minutes]` query command with verdict logic
- [x] Test all commands: start, stop, status, run, check

- [ ] Cross-provider support (future)
- [ ] Dashboard/JSONL integration with T11 (future)
- See [T12 details](tasks/T12.md)

## T16: Token-Usage Parser — 9.x Version Awareness + SQLite Migration Fix
- [x] Root-cause: version detection read stale Node v22 package.json (2026.6.34) instead of running v24.21.0 install (2026.9.4)
- [x] Root-cause: macOS sqlite3 URI mode (`file:...?mode=ro`) fails on temp files — use plain `sqlite3.connect()`
- [x] Root-cause: SQLite timestamps have `Z` suffix, `since`/`until` are local IST — string comparison always False
- [x] Add `_detect_openclaw_version()` — scans all NVM trees, returns max version
- [x] Add `detect_storage_backends()` — classifies jsonl/sqlite/mixed, emits version-specific warnings
- [x] Add `_normalise_ts()` — strips `Z` for cross-format timestamp comparison
- [x] Add mtime pre-filter to `find_sessions(since=...)` — skips 5,600+ stale files on `--today`
- [x] Report header shows version, backend, counts, and warnings
- [x] JSON output includes `openclaw_version`, `storage_backend`, `storage_counts`, `warnings`
- [x] Verified: `--today` returns real data (855K input / 51K output / $2.43), `--week` returns 26.3M / $35.82
