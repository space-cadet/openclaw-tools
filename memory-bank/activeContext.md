## Current Focus: T16 Token-Usage 9.x Version Awareness + SQLite Fix (2026-09-18)

T16 fixes the nightly report returning 0 tokens after the 9.x upgrade. Four compounding bugs: stale version detection (read Node v22 package.json instead of v24.21.0), macOS SQLite URI mode failure on temp files, timestamp `Z`-suffix mismatch between SQLite and local IST boundaries, and no mtime pre-filter (scanned all 5,600+ stale JSONL files). All fixed and verified — `--today` now returns 855K input / $2.43.

## Previous Focus: T14 OpenAI Luna Thinking Level Benchmark (2026-09-02)

T14 measures how reasoning effort (low → max) affects correctness, depth, and token usage on gpt-5.6-luna via native Codex authentication. The smoke test confirmed the mechanism works: both low and max thinking levels route through native Codex (provider: openai, api: openai-responses) with observable differences in output depth (99 vs 159 tokens on a simple geometric series proof).

The benchmark suite comprises 5 tasks of increasing complexity:
1. T1 — Geometric series proof (baseline, ✅ done)
2. T2 — Pivot reaction force (physics derivation with hidden trap)
3. T3 — Coin-flip Markov chain (counterintuitive probability)
4. T4 — Async closure bug (code review, execution state tracing)
5. T5 — Ramsey planner on graph (long-horizon planning)

Per-task: 5 subagents in parallel (low/medium/high/xhigh/max). Total: 25 subagents. Metrics: runtime, tokens, score breakdown, self-corrections, first-pass vs final score.

## Previous focus: T13 Kimi/OpenClaw long-context tool degradation (2026-08-23)

T13 records a repeatable cross-instance failure near 130k reported context. Remains open for cross-channel comparison and mirror-exclusion tests.

T11 is in planning. The design separates a direct provider probe from an optional OpenClaw-mediated harness, records every attempt in provider/model-agnostic JSONL, suppresses per-call notifications, and reserves hourly/four-hourly aggregate reports for user-facing delivery. It follows the existing cron-management maintenance flag and naming conventions.

T10 remains complete in code; ClawHub review remains pending.

The silent `availability-probe-openclaw` command cron is currently disabled after the diagnostic run. It is managed through `cronctl`; the CLI compatibility fix is pushed in `aa77518`. The reusable runner is pushed in `bd566ee`; local JSONL runtime data is intentionally untracked. T11 remains active for aggregate reporting.

The repository has two distinct result families: operational availability events in `data/model-availability/` and older task-capability benchmark artifacts in `tests/model-benchmarks/` and `kimi-benchmarks/`. Keep their raw schemas separate. A future derived `results/` layer should provide separate availability and capability aggregates plus an index.

The v2.4.0 code block is complete and pushed in commit `0371753`. ClawHub accepted the release for publication, but it is still pending review. The live latest tag remains 2.3.0 for now.

The direct parser and SQLite importer now use the same parser. T10 also fixed provider pricing, cache totals, date grouping, CLI windows, and cron reports.

Use simple language in notes. The code work is complete; only ClawHub review remains.

## Current Status: Token-Usage v2.3.0 Published (2026-07-27)

### What Just Happened (2026-07-28)
- **Workspace Scripts Convention Established**: Scripts that run as cron jobs now live PHYSICALLY in `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/` (the live copies), with backup copies in their respective repos.
  - `bot2bot-health-check.sh` → `code/bot2bot/check-pipeline-health.sh` (backup)
  - `bot2bot-start-webhook.sh` → `code/bot2bot/start-sage-webhook.sh` (backup)
  - `procmon-check-and-start.sh` → `code/process-monitor/check-and-start.sh` (backup)
  - Each script has a header comment directing: "If you edit this workspace copy, also copy to the repo and commit"
  - This ensures scripts survive a MacBook wipe (repos are on GitHub) while the live copies run from the workspace
- **Imported mem-* skills from Deepak's `.agents/skills/`**: `mem-update`, `mem-scan`, `mem-format`, `mem-load`
  - Adapted for Sage's workspace with **project-repo awareness** (Step 0)
  - **Problem fixed**: `mb-text-workflow` lacked project-repo awareness, causing T35c to be created in workspace instead of timesarrow repo
  - **Solution**: `mem-update` Step 0 scans ALL repos before creating tasks, preventing duplicate/wrong-location entries
  - **Sanitized**: Removed `/Users/deepak/` and `/Users/sage/` paths, replaced with `~/` and `${MB_CORE_PATH}`
  - **Skills added to repo**: `mem-format`, `mem-load`, `mem-scan`, `mem-update`
  - **Registry updated**: `skills-registry.json` now includes all 4 new skills (25 total)
  - **Committed**: Pending push

### Previous Major Work (2026-07-27)
- **Fixed timezone bug**: `--today`/`--yesterday` now use local timezone (Asia/Calcutta/IST) instead of UTC
  - Root cause: Daily cron at 04:00 IST was computing "yesterday" in UTC, getting wrong day
  - Fix: Added `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo("Asia/Calcutta")` to parse.py date boundary calculation
- **Fixed K3 pricing**: Session files store `"model":"k3"` but pricing.json only had `"kimi/k3"`
  - Fix: Added `"k3"` entry to pricing.json + alias fallback in `estimate_cost()`
- **Added missing file resilience**: Parser now skips deleted session files gracefully
- **ClawHub published**: token-usage@2.3.0 (k97d6heqfp7013mg1qvq4hq3ss8b8w8s)
- **Committed**: `5a3e1c3` on main

### Previous Major Work (2026-07-23)
- **Built `update-pricing.py`**: Multi-source pricing fetcher for model cost tracking
  - Fetches **342 models** from OpenRouter API (`/api/v1/models`)
  - Scrapes **Moonshot direct pricing** from official docs (CNY→USD at ~7.2 rate)
  - Creates `registry.json` with model metadata: availability, provider, context windows, alternative pricing
  - Compares sources: OpenRouter vs direct (e.g., K3: $2.78/M vs $3.00/M — ~8% markup)
- **Fixed `parse.py` bug**: None cache pricing caused TypeError in cost estimation
- **Updated weekly cron**: Token Usage — Weekly Report now refreshes pricing before generating report
- **ClawHub published**: v2.2.4 live (latest tag, 307 downloads) — multi-source pricing with OpenRouter + Moonshot direct
- **Committed**: `37f65af` on main

### Previous Major Work (2026-07-21)
- **Documented `agent-knowledge` ClawHub skill**: Created `skills/knowledge/SKILL.md` with usage docs, data model, and QMD integration
- **Updated README.md**: Added `knowledge` *(ClawHub)* to the skills index under Memory & Knowledge Management

### Previous Major Work (2026-07-20)
- **Created `cron-management` skill** — CLI tool for managing OpenClaw cron jobs

### Next Focus
- T2: Benchmark verification (tests moved, not yet verified post-move)
- T5: Token usage tracking — Phase 6: ClawHub publish with pricing features

### Open Questions
- Should tests/ have their own memory-bank or use repo-level one?
- GitHub Actions CI — worth it for a tools repo?
