# Progress: openclaw-tools Reorganization

## Completed (2026-09-18)

### T16: Token-Usage Parser — 9.x Version Awareness + SQLite Migration Fix
- **Root cause**: nightly report returned 0 tokens after 9.x upgrade
- **Four bugs found and fixed**:
  1. Version detection read stale Node v22 `package.json` (2026.6.34) instead of running v24.21.0 install (2026.9.4) — pre-9.x logic then ignored SQLite backend
  2. macOS `sqlite3.connect("file:...?mode=ro", uri=True)` fails on temp files — replaced with plain `sqlite3.connect()`
  3. SQLite timestamps have `Z` suffix (UTC), `--since` is local IST — string comparison always False. Added `_normalise_ts()` to strip `Z`
  4. No mtime pre-filter — added to `find_sessions(since=...)` so `--today` skips 5,600+ stale JSONL files
- **New features**: version detection, storage backend classifier, report header with version/backend/warnings, JSON output with `openclaw_version`/`storage_backend`/`storage_counts`/`warnings`
- **Verified**: `--today` returns 855K input / $2.43, `--week` returns 26.3M / $35.82
- See [T16 details](tasks/T16.md)

## In Progress (2026-09-02)

### T14: OpenAI Luna Thinking Level Benchmark
- **Smoke test completed** (T1: geometric series, low vs max)
  - Low: 8s, 99 output tokens, correct
  - Max: 10s, 159 output tokens, correct + partial sums insight
  - Native Codex routing confirmed (provider: openai, api: openai-responses)
- **T2 (pivot force) completed** — low/medium/high
  - Low: 18s, 443 tokens, **100/100** ✅ (R=5mg/2 upward)
  - Medium: 20s, 541 tokens, **50/100** ❌ (sign error: R=mg/2 downward)
  - High: 37s, 786 tokens, **50/100** ❌ (same sign error)
  - Key finding: Low outperformed medium/high — "overthinking" caused sign convention misinterpretation
- **Scoring rubric validated**: 40% answer / 30% approach / 20% trap / 10% clean
- Results recorded in `tests/thinking-benchmarks/results.json`
- 🔄 Next: Run T3 (Markov chain) across low/medium/high
- See [T14 details](tasks/T14.md)

- Recorded the deployed Kimi/DeepSeek availability cron and its local raw JSONL source in T11 memory-bank notes.
- Confirmed existing capability benchmark data remains under `tests/model-benchmarks/` and `kimi-benchmarks/`.
- Documented the separation between availability and capability schemas.
- Aggregate reports and a unified results index remain planned, not implemented.

### T10: Token-usage consistency across providers
- Audited the direct parser, SQLite importer, reports, pricing updater, and docs.
- Found that direct parsing and SQLite ingestion do not support the same session formats.
- Recorded the plan in `tasks/T10.md` and `implementation-details/token-usage.md`.
- Next: build one shared parser and add small tests.

### T10 update (2026-08-14)
- Added `skills/token-usage/scripts/common.py`.
- Connected the direct parser and SQLite importer to it.
- Added two parser tests.
- Remaining work: timezone boundaries, CLI flags, cron pricing, and full SQLite checks.

### T10 release (2026-08-14)
- Completed the v2.4.0 code block: shared parsing, Codex SQLite support, local dates, rolling windows, cache-aware reports, safe pricing, and comparison tests.
- Pushed commit `0371753`.
- ClawHub accepted v2.4.0 for publication. It is pending review; latest remains 2.3.0 until the review finishes.

## Completed (2026-07-27)

### Token-Usage v2.3.0: Timezone Fix, K3 Pricing, Model Aliases
- **Fixed timezone bug**: `--today`/`--yesterday` now use local timezone (Asia/Calcutta/IST)
  - Root cause: 04:00 IST cron was computing "yesterday" in UTC, showing wrong day
  - Fix: `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo("Asia/Calcutta")` in parse.py date boundaries
- **Fixed K3 pricing**: Added `"k3"` entry to pricing.json + alias fallback in `estimate_cost()`
  - Session files store short model names (`k3`) but pricing had only full names (`kimi/k3`)
- **Missing file resilience**: Parser skips deleted session files gracefully
- **Updated docs**: SKILL.md timezone behavior + model alias sections; skill-card.md v2.3.0 changelog
- **ClawHub published**: token-usage@2.3.0
- **Commit**: `5a3e1c3`

## Completed (2026-07-23)

### Token-Usage v2.2.0: Multi-Source Pricing & Model Registry
- **Created `update-pricing.py`** — multi-source pricing fetcher
  - OpenRouter API: 342 models with per-token pricing
  - Moonshot direct: scraped from platform.kimi.com/docs/pricing/, CNY→USD conversion
  - Output: `pricing.json` + `registry.json` with metadata
  - Price comparison: OpenRouter markup vs direct (K3: +8%, K2.7-code: +9%, K2.6: -24%)
- **Fixed `parse.py`**: None cache pricing TypeError bug
- **Updated weekly cron**: pricing refresh runs before report generation
- **ClawHub published**: v2.2.4 live (latest tag, 307 downloads)
- **Commit**: `37f65af`

## Completed (2026-07-21)

### Token-Usage v2.1.0 Update
- Enhanced `skills/token-usage/scripts/parse.py` with rolling time windows
  - `--hours N` — rolling N-hour window
  - `--since` / `--until` — ISO timestamps, dates, or relative (`1d`, `2h`, `30m`)
  - `--days N` — last N calendar days
  - `--yesterday` — single calendar day
  - `--cache` — include cache read/write columns
  - `--session-detail` — per-session breakdown with models
  - Mtime filtering for performance (skips unmodified files)
- Updated `SKILL.md` with v2.1.0 documentation
- Updated `skills-registry.json` — token-usage version 2.1.0
- Commits: `7bc7ede`, `88cc111`

### Knowledge Skill Documentation
- Documented `agent-knowledge` ClawHub skill in repo
- Created `skills/knowledge/SKILL.md` with usage, data model, QMD integration docs
- Updated `README.md` skills index
- Audit: 5 ClawHub skills installed, all now documented
- Commit: `61a8ded`

## Completed (2026-07-20)

### Cron Management Skill (T8)

- All have SKILL.md + skill-card.md + _meta.json
- skills-registry.json created for machine-readable index

### T4: Scripts Migration ✅
- **6 scripts** migrated with environment-based configuration
- check-disk.sh, crash-recovery.sh, heartbeat-watchdog.sh, netstatus.sh, protonvpn.sh, security-update-check.sh
